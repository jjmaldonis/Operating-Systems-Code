This project portfolio was developed in my operating systems class through various projects. We studied MINIX 3 and its various implementations. All code is written in C.

The each folder has a different project in it with a README.md and the code I developed / modified from the MINIX operating system. You can read the project descriptions in the readmes as well as how to build and execute the processes.

The code generally gets more advanced and better written in the later projects, culminating in the final_project where I implemented a virtual filesystem within a file.

My testfunctions folder is just a reference for me where I did some experimenting with different data types when I had to figure something out. The code inside is there for myself as a reminder if I ever need to go back and figure something out.
