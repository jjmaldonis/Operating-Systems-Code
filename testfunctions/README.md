These are just test functions for myself. You can ignore them.

The stringtest.c file deals with string manipulation.
The files.c file deals with how fread and fwrite are working with multiple files.
The time.c file works with time / date printing.
while.c is just a while loop that runs forever if you want to do that for some reason.
fork100procs.c deals with forking.
